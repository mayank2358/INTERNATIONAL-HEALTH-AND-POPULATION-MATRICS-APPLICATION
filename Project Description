# Introduction

United States Census Bureau created the international database to provide timely information regarding the demographic measures of population around the world[1]. This database consists of various indicators and it has been updated regularly to provide useful information for program planning, research and policy-making globally. International Database provides information of 228 countries where the population is more than 5000[1]. It provides comprehensive statistics about population size by age and sex, and  factors of population change such as fertility, migration and mortality from 1950 to 2050[2].
Demographic analysis is a technique used to develop an understanding of the age, sex, and racial composition of a population and how it has changed over time through the basic demographic processes of birth, death, and migration. Demographic Analysis (usually abbreviated as DA) also refers to a specific set of techniques for developing national population estimates by age, sex, and race from administrative records to be used to assess the quality of the decennial census. Our datasets have data about population, age, mortality rate, year, country, fertility rate and birth death ratio. Which can be analysed to discover knowledge and demographics.

# Motivation

The world population has experienced continuous growth and it is estimated to have reached 7.7 billion people as of December 2019. There are various factors involved in population development and it can be analysed using attributes such as age, sex, population by age, fertility rate, mortality rate, infant mortality, net migration. Diversity in population can affect fundamental challenges that world is facing or might face such as assurance of food, provision of social protection, health, education and other goods and services. Some other challenges such as environmental factors , global warming , climate change and adaptation must be addressed to ensure sustainable development of humanity. It is possible to predict accurate requirement of goods and services which can lead to higher living standards and steady technological and economic development. Demographics can be used by companies to drill down ideal customers and discovering profitable opportunities for marketing their products. For example a health services company can target old age audience as they might need more medical attention than younger population. It can be concluded that demographics can be used to predict current and future requirement of civilizations including various social, economic and business needs.
