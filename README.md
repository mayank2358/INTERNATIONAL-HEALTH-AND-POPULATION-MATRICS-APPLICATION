# INTERNATIONAL-HEALTH-AND-POPULATION-MATRICS-APPLICATION

We have attempted to bring out maximum relevant information from the data available to us and summarized them into a set of functionalities that the database application sought to provide.

Our database will consist of International Data categorized into five major elements that we identified as main entities, namely: Birth Rate, Growth Rate, Infant Mortality Rate, Midyear Population and Population Density. The dataset provides the information from 1950 and projections through 2050 and examine various factors associated with population change[2]. All the functionalities of the web application will revolve around extracting useful information from the available data sets and visualizing them to generate insights to make it more interactive and exact[7][8]. In our database, user shall be able to access visualized country specific details such as which country has most infant mortality rate by year, their population change during specific years, their growth trends, migration rate for each country and how it has affected the growth of the country. The interface is intended to be highly user friendly while not compromising on the level of details that the users expect to see when they utilize the various features of our application. The idea is to provide ease of access to information about the world population, various factors affecting the population in various countries[9]. In the dataset we have 8 tables and more than one million records.
